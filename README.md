# Oscars 2025 Prediction Web App

This is a simple static web app where users can make predictions for the Oscars 2025. 

## Overview

This project took me a couple of hours to build, given my no prior experience with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The idea came about because I thought it would be easier to create my own Oscar prediction card generator website rather than making one manually(I hate photoshop). It’s still a work in progress but functional!

So far, it’s working decently, but I haven't tested it on mobile devices yet.
Maybe I’ll dive back into it when i feel like doing frontend again later and fix that and maybe Not.
